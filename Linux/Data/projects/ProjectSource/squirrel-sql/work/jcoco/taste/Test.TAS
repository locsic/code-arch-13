(* This is a test program which can be compiled by the Taste-compiler.
  It reads a null-terminated sequence of numbers from a data input file
  and computes the sum of these numbers.*)

PROGRAM Test;
VAR i: INTEGER;
  
  PROCEDURE SumUp;
  VAR sum: INTEGER;
  BEGIN
    sum:=0;
    WHILE i>0 DO sum:=sum+i; i:=i-1 END;
    WRITE sum;
  END SumUp;
    
BEGIN
  READ i;
  WHILE i>0 DO
    SumUp;
    READ i 
  END
END Test.

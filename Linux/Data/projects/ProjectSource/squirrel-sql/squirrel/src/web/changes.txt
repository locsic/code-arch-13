Change Log
==========

Warning: In 1.0beta3 the layout of the XML files that store the drivers
         and aliases were changed. Your old files will be stored in your user
         preferences directory (E.G. \winnt\profiles\user_name\.squirrel-sql)
         under the names drivers.xml and db_aliases.xml. The new files are
         SQLDrivers.xml and SQLAliases.xml.

1.0 final2
===============================

Bug Fixes
---------
- Put up a new splash screen that worked with JDK1.4

The following fixes were actually done in 1.0final1 but I forget
to update this file.

- Removed wrong path separator used in the install script for
  <instdir>\plugins\lafs and <instdir>\plugins\skins which
  didn't work under Unix.
- Got working with Sybase/jConnect.


1.0 final
===============================

Bug Fixes
------------
- Handle gracefully the errors caused by JDBC drivers that require a more
  recent version of the JDK than the one that Squirrel SQL is being run on.
- Popup menus are now correctly positioned under JDK1.2 

Enhancements
------------
- I'm now using the IzPack Java installer from
  http://www.izforge.com/izpack 
- Thanks to Greg Mackness, Squirrel SQL now has a decent splash screen.

1.0 beta6
===============================

Bug Fixes
------------
- New sessions didn't take into account the "SQL Limit Rows"
  setting from the "New Session" Application Settings tab. It
  always defaulted to true. 
- The hourglass cursor was shown after the main window was created.
- If the preferences positioned the main window (or aliases/drivers
  tool windows) to a position on the screen only visible under a
  high resolution (EG 1024X768) and you then changed the display
  resolution to one under which the window could not be seen then
  when Squirrel-SQL was started the window could not be seen.
- If you tried to maintain a driver with a Driver JAR file that
  didn't exist an error dialog that couldn't be dismissed was
  displayed.
- Errors that occured for metadata information (such as data types) didn't
  always display in the message area.
- Errors in SQL Driver Maintenance weren't always displayed.
- If invalid data for the data type in a column (E.G. blanks in a numeric)
  were found in metadata information (such as data types) then no further
  information was displayed.

Enhancements
------------
- User name now displayed in the title for a session window.
- Logging is now done to a text file (squirrel-sql.log) in the user
  perferences directory instead of to standard output.
- You can now drop a Look and Feel implementation (see www.javatoo.com
  for examples of Look and Feel implementations) into the /plugins/lafs
  directory within the application directory and have it selectable from
  the "Look and Feel" dropdown on the General tab of the Global
  Preferences dialog.

Changes
-------
- Global Preferences option is now on the File menu.

===============================

Bug Fixes
------------

- Changing the class name of a driver wouldn't always take effect util 
  Squirrel-SQL was restarted.
- The session properties dialog is now correctly positioned on screen.
- The Class Loader used for the JDBC drivers wasn't searching for classes
  correctly.

Enhancements

  is controlled by a new session setting.
- The Aliases and Drivers lists are now in their own windows.
- A "Connect To" dropdown has been added to the toolbar.
- The SQL tab in the Application Preferences dialog has been split into
  two tabs; global settings that apply to all open sessions and a Default
  tab that applies to new sessions.
- If the Look and Feel is changed it is not shown until the application
  is restarted. Not all components are rendered correctly if the Look and
  Feel is changed on the fly.
- The System Status dialog has been merged with the About Box.
- New global property - Show Tooltips.

  alias/driver had its name changed or one was deleted.

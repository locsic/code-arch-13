<A NAME="introduction"><H2>Introduction</H2></A>
There are two pieces of information you need to supply to connect to a
database; the driver and the alias. The driver specifies the JDBC driver to
use and the alias specifies the connection parameters.

<A NAME="the_driver"><H2>The Driver</H2></A>

<P>A number of default driver definitions ship with SQuirreL SQL Client.
These can be seen in the Drivers Tool Window (<EM>View Drivers</EM> option
on the <EM>Windows</EM> menu) when you first start up
SQuirreL SQL Client. You can create new ones using the <EM>New Driver</EM>
option on the <EM>Drivers</EM> menu.

<P>&nbsp;<IMG SRC="images/drivers_tool_window_1.png" BORDER="0" ALIGN="CENTER" ALT="Drivers Tool Window">

The drivers tool window.

<P>All of the default driver definitions assume that the JDBC driver
classes are in the current class path. If this is not the case you will
need to modify the driver definition to point to the jar file that
contains these classes.

<P>This is an example of a driver definition. This dialog can be displayed
by selecting a driver definition in the Drivers Tool Window and then
selecting the <E>Modify Driver</EM> option from the <EM>Drivers</EM> menu.

<P>&nbsp;<IMG SRC="images/chg_driver_1.png" BORDER="0" ALT="Change Driver dialog">

<P>The <EM>Name</EM> text field specifies an easy to remember name for the
database driver definition.

<P>When <E>checked</EM> the <EM>Load Driver from CLASSPATH</EM> checkbox
specifies that the classes for the JDBC driver can be found in the
current class path. If unchecked then the jar file containing the
classes must be specified in the <EM>Jar File</EM> text field.

<P>For JDBC drivers that are not loaded from the current class path the
<EM>Jar File</EM> text field specifies the jar file that contains
the JDBC driver class files. This file can be browsed for via the browse
button next to this field.

<P>The <EM>Driver Class Name</EM> specifies the class name of the JDBC
driver. For drivers located by an entry in the <EM>Jar File</EM> text field
all the names of driver classes in the jar file will be displayed in this
dropdown. For drivers loaded from the class path you will have to enter the
class name manually (it can normally be found in the documentation
that comes with the driver). A future enhancement will allow drivers loaded
from the class path to be auto-detected as well.

<P>The <EM>Example URL</EM> shows an example URL for this driver. This can
be found in the documentation that comes with the driver.

<P>Press the OK button to save the driver definition.

<A NAME="the_alias"><H2>The Alias</H2></A>

<P>Now you need to create an alias to your database.

<P>Display the Aliases tool window (View Aliases option on the Windows menu).
When you run SQuirreL SQL Client for the first time this window will be
empty.

<P>&nbsp;<IMG SRC="images/aliases_tool_window_1.png" BORDER="0" ALIGN="CENTER" ALT="Aliases Tool Window">

The aliases tool window.

<P>Take the <EM>New Alias</EM> option from the <EM>Aliases</EM> menu and
the following dialog will be displayed.

<P>&nbsp;<IMG SRC="images/add_alias_1.png" BORDER="0" ALT="Add Alias dialog">

<P>Enter a easy to remember name in the <EM>Name</EM> field for this
database URL.

<P>Select the driver for this alias from the <EM>Driver</EM> dropdown or
click on the <EM>New</EM> button to create a new driver definition.

<P>Change the <EM>URL</EM> to point to your database.

<P>Optionally enter a user name if you want the alias to default to a
specific user.

<P>Press the OK button to save the alias definition.

<A NAME="connecting"><H2>Connecting</H2></A>

<P>The new alias should now appear in the <EM>Connect To</EM> dropdown.
Select it in the dropdown and enter your user name and password in the
connection dialog, press OK and you should be connected.

<A NAME="executing"><H2>Executing SQL</H2></A>

<P>SQL can be executed from the SQL tab in the window that opens once
you have connected to an alias. Multiple statements can be executed
and the results will be displayed in multiple tabs below the SQL entry
area.</P>

<P>When the SQL tab is selected pressing <TT>&lt;ctrl&gt;&lt;enter&gt;</TT>,
taking the Execute SQL option from the Session menu or pressing the Execute
SQL button in the session windows toolbar will execute the entered SQL.</P>

<P>If a single statment is entered then pressing <TT>&lt;ctrl&gt;&lt;enter&gt;</TT>
will execute just that statement.</P>

<P>If you only want to execute part of the SQL entered then hightlight the
SQL that you want to execute and press <TT>&lt;ctrl&gt;&lt;enter&gt;</TT>.</P>

<P>To only execute a single statement amongst several statements (separated
from the other statements by at least one blank line) within the SQL entry
area then click on the line containing the statement that you want to execute
and press <TT>&lt;ctrl&gt;&lt;enter&gt;</TT>

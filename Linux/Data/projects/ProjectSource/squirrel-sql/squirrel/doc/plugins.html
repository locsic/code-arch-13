<A NAME="introduction"><H3>Introduction</H3></A>

A plugin is an application written in Java that runs within SQuirreL. This
allows developers to enhance the functionality of SQuirreL without having to
rebuild the SQuirreL application itself.

<P>This document (like the plugin API itself) is in a very early stage and is lagging
behind the plugin API. Its suggested that you check the existing plugins in CVS to
see how they use the API.

<A NAME="packagename"><H3>What Package can I put my Plugin into?</H3></A>

If you already have a domain name that you use for naming java packages
and you'd like to use that then by all means do so. If you don't have a domain
name then as a convienience the package
<TT>net.sourceforge.squirrel_sql.plugins.&lt;internal_name&gt;</TT> is available. Using
this package name does <EM>not</EM> in any way imply ownership of your code. This resides
with you under the conditions of the licence that you have selected for your
plugin.

<A NAME="licence"><H3>What Licence should I Use?</H3></A>

Please bear in mind when you are reading this section that I am not a lawyer. All
my comments reflect how I believe licencing of free and open source software
works. If you have any questions I suggest you consult a lawyer.

<P>If you're just writing a plugin for your personal use then licencing
doesn't matter but if you intend to distibute your plugin (either through
the SourceForge release system in the SQuirreL SQL Client project or in any
other way) then the licence you select should be compatible with the GNU General
Public Licence that SQuirreL is distributed under.

<P>I believe (although as I said I am not a lawyer) that as long as your plugin
is dynamically linked into SQuirreL (as it will be because thats how the
plugin API works) then any OSI approved licence should be appropriate.

<P>Unless you have a philosophical dislike of the GNU GPL I suggest you release
your plugin under it so that I don't wonder if your choice of licence is
going to cause me any problems &lt;grin/&gt;.

<P>For more information about licences please see <A HREF="http://www.fsf.org">The Free
Software Foundation</A>, the <A HREF="http://www.opensource.org/">Open Source Initiative</A>
or the <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/docman/display_doc.php?docid=778&group_id=1">
documents</A> at SouceForge about selecting a licence.

<A NAME="internalname"><H3>The Internal Name</H3></A>

A plugins internal name is used to uniquely identify it and so
must be different to that of any other plugin. It is supplied by
implementing the <TT>IPlugin.getInternalName()</TT> method. As the
internal name is used to name files and directories it should
only consist of characters valid on the different platforms that SQuirreL
can run on. As well the character &quot;-&quot; is reserved for internal
use.</P>

<P>As an example the internal name for the <EM>Look and Feel</EM> plugin
is <TT>laf</TT>.</P>

<P>To reserve an internal name just email a request to the SQuirreL
developers mailing list (details at http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/squirrel-sql-develop)
specifying the internal name that you'd like and a quick description of your plugin.</P>

<A NAME="files"><H3>Files and Directories</H3></A>

Plugins are installed as a jar file within the <TT>&lt;squirrel_app&gt;/plugins</TT>
directory. The name of the jar file should be the same as the internal name of
one of the plugins within it plus a <TT>.jar</TT> extension. E.G. if the
internal name of the plugin is <TT>laf</TT> then the jar file should be
named <TT>laf.jar</TT>. No other files should be placed within the
<TT>&lt;squirrel_app&gt;/plugins</TT> directory.

<P>The directory <TT>&lt;squirrel_app&gt;/plugins/&lt;internal_name&gt;</TT>
is reserved for the exclusive use of the plugin. All other files required
by the plugin should be placed in here.</P>

<P>The directory <TT>&lt;user_home&gt;/.squirrel-sql/plugins/&lt;internal_name&gt;</TT>
is also reserved for the exclusive use of the plugin. All &quot;per-user&quot;
files should be placed in here.</P>

<A NAME="loading"><H3>How Plugins are Loaded</H3></A>

Plugins are loaded very early in the SQuirreL startup process. Once the
application logger has been created (<TT>IApplication.getLogger())</TT> the
plugins are loaded. All jars in the <TT>&lt;squirrel_app&gt;/plugins</TT>
directory are loaded by a custom class loader. They are searched for
all classes that implement the <TT>IPlugin</TT> interface. Then
<TT>newInstance</TT> is used
to create an instance of each of these plugin classes. Once created the
<TT>IPlugin.load()</TT> method is called. Because most of the SQuirreL
environment hasn't yet been setup try not to use the plugin constuctor and
<TT>load()</TT>method to do initialisation. Instead use the <TT>IPlugin.initialize()</TT>
method.

<P><TT>IPlugin.initialize()</TT> is called as the last part of the
SQuirreL startup prior to showing the main window. This is where initialization
of the plugin should occur. Please try to keep the amount of code executed
here to a minimum as it will affect the startup time of SQuirreL. If
possible do plugin initialization when a plugin is first requested by the user.</P>

<A NAME="pluginclasses"><H3>Plugin Classes</H3></A>

All plugin jars should contain at least one class that implements the
interface <TT>net.sourceforge.squirrel_sql.client.plugin.IPugin</TT>. If
your plugin is applicable to a session then it should implement the
descendent of <TT>IPlugin</TT>,
<TT>net.sourceforge.squirrel_sql.client.plugin.ISessionPlugin</TT>. As a convienence
two abstract base classes have been supplied:
<TT>net.sourceforge.squirrel_sql.client.plugin.DefaultPlugin</TT> and
<TT>net.sourceforge.squirrel_sql.client.plugin.DefaultSessionPlugin</TT>. As
well as supplying some useful base behaviour these base classes should guard
against additions to the base interfaces breaking existing implementations.
Every attempt will be made to supply appropriate default behaviour (usually
an empty method) to the base classes for every method added to the interfaces.

<A NAME="api"><H3>Plugin API</H3></A>

There are two main ways for a plugin to communicate with SQuirreL. These are
via the <TT>net.sourceforge.squirrel_sql.client.IApplication</TT> interface
which specifies the application level API and
<TT>net.sourceforge.squirrel_sql.client.session.ISession</TT> which specifies
the session level API. From within a descendent of <TT>BasePlugin</TT> you
can call <TT>getApplication()</TT> to get the <TT>IApplication</TT> object
and descendents of <TT>BaseSessionPlugin</TT> will have <TT>ISession</TT>
passed on requests.</P>

<A NAME="sqlexecution"><H4>Hooking into SQL Execution</H4></A>

The method <TT>ISession.addSQLExecutionListener(ISQLExecutionListener</TT>)
allows you to &quot;listen&quot; for SQL being executed in the SQL panel and modify
it. Remember to use <TT>ISession.removeSQLExecutionListener(ISQLExecutionListener)</TT>
to remove the listener when you are finished with it.

<P><TT>ISQLExecutionListener</TT> specifies one method:

<PRE>
public String statementExecuting(String sql)
</PRE>

<P>This method is called for every statement to be executed in the SQL panel. E.G. If the
user enters the following in the SQL panel:

<PRE>
select * from table1;
select * from table2
</PRE>

and requests them both to be executed then <TT>statementExecuting()</TT> will be
called twice. Once with <TT>&quot;select * from table1&quot;</TT> passed and the
second time with <TT>&quot;select * from table2&quot;</TT>.

<P>Whatever you return from the method (allowing for any changes that other plugins
may make) is what will be executed. If you return <TT>null</TT> then no other listeners
will be called and the statement will not be executed.

<P>This would be useful for macro expansion etc.

<A NAME="xml"><H3>XML</H3></A>

SQuirreL now comes with the XML parser <A HREF="http://NanoXML.sourceforge.net/">NanoXML</A>.
Previously it came with <A HREF="http://www.jdom.org/">JDOM</A> but as I was using
almost none of the available functionality I replaced it with with a smaller one.
